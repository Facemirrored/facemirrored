### Hi there lads ðŸ‘‹

This is my ever long main project for developing a homepage with a classical frontend / backend concept. Here I will try
to train my skills, getting better through new ideas and more experience while having just fun on developing at home.
Though it can be difficult developing after my normal daily programmers-work, I will give my best to maintenance this
project as good as possible.

Like I said: at the end, it is the fun standing at the foreground included with some bonuses for new experience et
cetera.

## What will you (hopefully) see?

I want to build a homepage giving me as an admin the possibility to edit/manipulate/manage specific subcomponents,
create blogs talking about my page, how I developed this page and explain some stuff. Maybe other people will have the
chance creating an account (with as small complexity as possible), to create their own stuff on specific areas of the
homepage. Managed with a database to store specific content, it would be a chance share data between friends/family of
mine on this homepage. Later, it should be possible to access the data with the mobile phone too via app (another
project for another time). I don't want to write a roman here, so this is it for now! ðŸ˜„

## Technologies

So like at the beginning (very vague) described, this homepage is build on two main modules:

- Spring Boot backend: here I will put all "invisible" backend logic (like access a database to get data for the
  frontend)
- Vue3 frontend: just the GUI with all its magic ðŸ˜‰

Never heard about those frameworks? No problem, just RDFM:

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)

Here, I have no time restrictions, can try things out and do my stuff clean (don't get me wrong: u should always try to
get ur stuff clean, but reality is not always kind to you, if you are working or doing similar stuff with all it's rocks
in the way).
